APImetrics API Samples are designed to help developers learn how to use the APImetrics platform.

APImetrics's API provides developers with:

    A RESTful API to enable DIY control and oversight of APIs, apps, and developers
    API Key and OAuth 1 and 2 support
    Out-of-the-box policies for functionality that you would rather not code yourself (like quotas, transformations, response caching, etc.)
    APIs and scripting support for functionality that you would rather innovate and code yourself
    The ability to share your work with other developers, and to reuse it across your own projects, by exposing it as APIs that you own and control
    Scalable, managed test and prod environments with operational analytics


#Getting started

All of these samples require you to have an account on: https://client.apimetrics.io/

You can sign up for a trial account at: https://client.apimetrics.io/register

Once registered, you will need to generate an API key to use with these sample scripts.

To get your API Key, visit: https://client.apimetrics.io/settings/api-key

Once you have an API key, enter it in the file 'set_env.sh'

#What's here:

Currently, this contains a few simple scripts that are designed to set up an API call in APImetrics.
